# Best Practice Rules
This repository holds a recommended set of rules for the [Best Practice Analyzer](https://github.com/otykier/TabularEditor/wiki/Best-Practice-Analyzer) of [Tabular Editor](https://tabulareditor.github.io/) .

To use these rules, simply download the BPARules.json file from the releases page. Store the file in one of the following locations:

* `%AppData%\..\Local\TabularEditor` to make the rules available only for you.
* `%ProgramData%\TabularEditor` to make the rules available for everyone on your local machine.

...and restart Tabular Editor. You should then see the rules show up in Best Practice Analyzer:
